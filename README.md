# Water Pollution Detection using Image Classification (Sustainability Theme)

## Project Problem Statement
The world is facing severe environmental degradation due to unsustainable consumption of natural resources, rapid urbanization, and pollution.  
Water pollution, in particular, has become one of the most pressing environmental challenges harming aquatic life, affecting human health, and disrupting ecosystems.

There is a critical need for **sustainable technological solutions** that can monitor and prevent water contamination.  
To address this, this project proposes an **AI-powered water pollution detection system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
By analyzing images of water bodies, the model can automatically classify them as **Clean** or **Polluted**, providing a fast, cost-effective, and scalable approach to monitor water quality.

## Sustainability Focus
This project directly supports **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**.  
Through automation and image-based analysis, it promotes:
- Efficient and **eco-friendly monitoring** of water resources.  
- Early detection of pollution to reduce environmental damage.  
- **Awareness and data-driven decision-making** for sustainable water management.

## Dataset Details
- **Dataset Name:** [Clean vs Dirty Water Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinagammed/clean-dirty-water-dataset)  
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Type:** Image Dataset

## Project Workflow
1. **Collect & Prepare Dataset:**  
   Organize images into “clean” and “polluted” categories.
2. **Train the CNN Model:**  
   Use **Keras (MobileNetV2)** for training.
3. **Evaluate the Model:**  
   Measure accuracy, loss, and visualize performance metrics.
4. **Test the Model:**  
   Validate using unseen test images.
5. **Build Web Interface (Future Step):**  
   Integrate model into a **Streamlit**
6. **Deploy & Document:**  
   Upload source code, model, and documentation on GitHub.

## Sustainability Benefits
- Enables **AI-driven environmental monitoring**.  
- Reduces **manual water testing costs and time**.  
- Supports **data-driven environmental policies**.  
- Contributes to a **greener and smarter ecosystem**.  

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time camera-based water pollution detection using **OpenCV**.  
- Integration with **IoT water sensors** for hybrid analysis.  
- Web dashboard for pollution alerts and live visualization.  
- Extension to detect specific pollutants (plastic, oil, etc.).
